    "# Lab 5: Git/GitHub Tutorial\n",
    "Git and Github are two different things:\n",
    "* Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files, enables collaboration, and facilitates code management through branching, merging, and history tracking.\n",
    "    - This is something that's done in the command line. \n",
    "* GitHub is a cloud-based platform that provides Git repository hosting, collaboration tools, and project management features for developers to store, share, and manage their code.\n",
    "  There are other services that do the same thing--such as gitlab and bitbucket, but we'll focus on github for this class.\n",
    "    - This is somethign usually managed on a web-browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have that out of the way, many people tend to use these terms interchangeably.\n",
    "Just keep that in mind for the rest of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub essentials\n",
    "Before we head to the basics, create/log in your GitHub account.\n",
    "I reccomend using your UCSD email since it will give you extra access to tools, but not necessary for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repositories\n",
    "* A repository is usually used to organize a single project.\n",
    "* Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs. \n",
    "* Often, repositories include a README file, a file with information about your project written in the plain text Markdown language.\n",
    "    - Discord uses a simpler version of markdown for formatting\n",
    "    - Markdown is what is used to format these text cells\n",
    "    - You can double-click on this cell to see an example of how stuff would be formatted on a README\n",
    "    - A Markdown language [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to practice markdown within this cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practice:** Create your own repo on github."

    "### Branches\n",
    "* Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.\n",
    "* Your repository has only one branch named `main` by default, but you can create additional branches off of `main` in your repository.\n",
    "  You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time.\n",
    "  This is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code. \n",
    "* The work done on different branches will not show up on the `main` branch until you merge it.\n",

    "### Commits\n",
    "* When you created a new branch in the previous step, GitHub brought you to the code page for your new `readme-edits` branch, which is a copy of `main`.\n",
    "* You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. \n",
    "* Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description tha captures the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.\n",

    "* Now that you have changes in a branch off of `main`, you can open a pull request.\n",

    "  When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.\n",
    "  Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.\n",
    "* As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.\n",
    "  By using GitHub's `@mention` feature in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams.\n",

    "cd ~\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sure that whatever we clone will be outside of any other git repos.\n",
    "Then we'll want to continue with the cloning.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy the HTTPS URL of your repository from GitHub.\n",
    "2. Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/[your user name here]/test\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This will create a directory with the same name as your repo linked to your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory and create a new Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the Jupyter interface, create a new notebook and save it as `my_notebook.ipynb`.\n",
    "- Add some content and save the notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Check the status of your changes:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git status\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add the notebook to the staging area:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git add my_notebook.ipynb\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   If you want to add all changes in the repository, use:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git add .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This is usually not a great idea.\n",
    "\n",

    "   ```bash\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have local changes that conflict with the remote repository, you need to resolve them before pulling updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Local Changes Before Pulling\n",
    "If you have uncommitted changes, you have three options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Commit the changes** before pulling:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git commit -m \"Updated analysis\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stash the changes**, pull the remote updates, and then reapply your changes:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git stash\n",
    "   git pull\n",
    "   git stash pop\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Discard local changes** and reset to the latest remote version:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git reset --hard  # Discards all changes\n",
    "   git checkout filename  # Discards changes to a specific file\n",

    "- Distributed Version Control\n",
    "  - Resolve most of the above issues...\n",
